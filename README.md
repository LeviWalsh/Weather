Weather is a very simple app that lets you view the current weather at your location, as well as a description of the weather at the time. The app also gives you the nearest time that has a high likelihood of raining (> 50% chance), as well as a visual representation of the moon phase that day. The background is set to be a mood gradient of the current weather.
